    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column SPA. The left column is a fixed navigation list of all LeetCode problems, allowing for quick jumps. The right column displays the detailed content for the selected problem. This content is organized into three tabs: "Problem", "Solution", and "Analysis" to prevent information overload and allow for focused study. An "Overview" section with a chart is included for high-level comparison. This structure was chosen to transform the linear report into a non-linear, user-driven study tool, which is more effective for interview prep. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Problem name, description, code, complexities, analysis. Goal: Organize, Compare, Inform. Viz/Presentation Method: The primary information is presented in structured HTML using a tabbed interface for clarity. Code is in styled <pre><code> blocks with a copy button. For the mandatory visualization requirement, a "Complexity Overview" bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is used. It maps qualitative time complexities (O(n), O(n^2), etc.) to a numerical scale to provide a visual summary of problem difficulties, which is a key aspect of the report. A dropdown allows filtering the chart by problem difficulty (Easy, Medium). Interaction: Click-based navigation via the side-list and content tabs. A button to copy code snippets enhances usability. Tooltips on the chart provide detailed complexity info on hover. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for logic, Tailwind for styling, Chart.js for visualization. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
