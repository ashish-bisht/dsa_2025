# Cutting Wood Algorithm: Finding the Optimal Woodcutter Height

## Problem Statement

You are given:
- An array `treeHeights` representing the heights of trees
- An integer `requiredWood` representing the total length of wood that needs to be cut

A woodcutting machine is set to a certain height, `cutterHeight`. The machine cuts off the top part of all trees taller than `cutterHeight`, while trees shorter than `cutterHeight` remain untouched.

**Goal:** Determine the highest possible setting of the woodcutter (`cutterHeight`) so that it cuts at least `requiredWood` meters of wood.

**Constraint:** The woodcutter cannot be set higher than the height of the tallest tree in the array.

## Understanding the Problem with a Visual Example

Let's visualize this problem with a small example:

```
treeHeights = [5, 2, 8, 7, 3]
requiredWood = 8
```

Now, let's visualize the trees:

```
    #
    #
    #     #
    #     #
#   #     #
#   #     #
# # # # # #
5 2 8 7 3
```

If we set the `cutterHeight` to 6, we'd cut:
- 2 units from the tree of height 8 (8-6=2)
- 1 unit from the tree of height 7 (7-6=1)
- Total wood cut: 2+1=3 units (Not enough)

If we set the `cutterHeight` to 5, we'd cut:
- 3 units from the tree of height 8 (8-5=3)
- 2 units from the tree of height 7 (7-5=2)
- Total wood cut: 3+2=5 units (Not enough)

If we set the `cutterHeight` to 4, we'd cut:
- 4 units from the tree of height 8 (8-4=4)
- 3 units from the tree of height 7 (7-4=3)
- 1 unit from the tree of height 5 (5-4=1)
- Total wood cut: 4+3+1=8 units (Equal to required)

So, the answer is 4.

## Thinking Through the Algorithm

This problem is well-suited for a binary search approach because:

1. We have a clear search space: the height can be between 0 and the maximum tree height
2. We have a monotonic function: as the cutter height decreases, the amount of wood cut increases
3. We're looking for the maximum height that satisfies our condition

## Algorithm Steps

1. Find the maximum tree height to establish the upper bound of our search space
2. Use binary search between 0 and max height to find the optimal cutter height
3. For each height we test, calculate the total wood cut
4. Keep track of the highest valid height found

## Implementation

```python
def find_optimal_cutter_height(tree_heights, required_wood):
    """
    Find the highest possible woodcutter height to cut at least the required amount of wood.
    
    Args:
        tree_heights: List of tree heights
        required_wood: Required amount of wood to be cut
        
    Returns:
        Optimal cutter height
    """
    # Edge case: if no trees or no wood required
    if not tree_heights or required_wood <= 0:
        return 0
    
    # Define the search space
    left_height = 0
    right_height = max(tree_heights)
    
    # Variable to store our result
    optimal_height = 0
    
    # Binary search
    while left_height <= right_height:
        mid_height = (left_height + right_height) // 2
        
        # Calculate wood cut at this height
        wood_cut = calculate_wood_cut(tree_heights, mid_height)
        
        print(f"Testing cutter height: {mid_height}, Wood cut: {wood_cut}, Required: {required_wood}")
        
        if wood_cut >= required_wood:
            # This height works, but we want to maximize it
            optimal_height = mid_height
            left_height = mid_height + 1  # Try higher heights
        else:
            # This height doesn't produce enough wood
            right_height = mid_height - 1  # Try lower heights
    
    return optimal_height

def calculate_wood_cut(tree_heights, cutter_height):
    """
    Calculate how much wood will be cut at the given cutter height.
    
    Args:
        tree_heights: List of tree heights
        cutter_height: Height of the woodcutter
        
    Returns:
        Total amount of wood cut
    """
    total_wood = 0
    
    for height in tree_heights:
        # Only cut trees taller than cutter height
        if height > cutter_height:
            total_wood += height - cutter_height
    
    return total_wood
```

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's trace through our algorithm with the example: `tree_heights = [5, 2, 8, 7, 3]` and `required_wood = 8`

### Initialization:
- `left_height = 0`
- `right_height = max([5, 2, 8, 7, 3]) = 8`
- `optimal_height = 0`

### Iteration 1:
- `mid_height = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4`
- Calculate wood cut at height 4:
  - Tree 1 (height 5): Cut 5-4 = 1 unit
  - Tree 2 (height 2): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Tree 3 (height 8): Cut 8-4 = 4 units
  - Tree 4 (height 7): Cut 7-4 = 3 units
  - Tree 5 (height 3): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Total wood cut: 1 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 8 units
- Since 8 >= 8 (required wood), this height works!
- Update `optimal_height = 4`
- Set `left_height = 4 + 1 = 5` (try higher heights)

### Iteration 2:
- `mid_height = (5 + 8) // 2 = 6`
- Calculate wood cut at height 6:
  - Tree 1 (height 5): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Tree 2 (height 2): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Tree 3 (height 8): Cut 8-6 = 2 units
  - Tree 4 (height 7): Cut 7-6 = 1 unit
  - Tree 5 (height 3): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Total wood cut: 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 units
- Since 3 < 8 (required wood), this height doesn't work
- Set `right_height = 6 - 1 = 5` (try lower heights)

### Iteration 3:
- `mid_height = (5 + 5) // 2 = 5`
- Calculate wood cut at height 5:
  - Tree 1 (height 5): Cut 0 units (tree is equal)
  - Tree 2 (height 2): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Tree 3 (height 8): Cut 8-5 = 3 units
  - Tree 4 (height 7): Cut 7-5 = 2 units
  - Tree 5 (height 3): Cut 0 units (tree is shorter)
  - Total wood cut: 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 5 units
- Since 5 < 8 (required wood), this height doesn't work
- Set `right_height = 5 - 1 = 4` (try lower heights)

Now, `right_height = 4` and `left_height = 5`, so the loop terminates.
We return `optimal_height = 4`.

## Visual Trace with Heights 0 through 8

Let's see what happens at every possible cutter height for our example:

```
Height 0: Cut 5+2+8+7+3 = 25 units (✓ but not optimal)
Height 1: Cut 4+1+7+6+2 = 20 units (✓ but not optimal)
Height 2: Cut 3+0+6+5+1 = 15 units (✓ but not optimal)
Height 3: Cut 2+0+5+4+0 = 11 units (✓ but not optimal)
Height 4: Cut 1+0+4+3+0 = 8 units  (✓ optimal!)
Height 5: Cut 0+0+3+2+0 = 5 units  (✗ not enough)
Height 6: Cut 0+0+2+1+0 = 3 units  (✗ not enough)
Height 7: Cut 0+0+1+0+0 = 1 unit   (✗ not enough)
Height 8: Cut 0+0+0+0+0 = 0 units  (✗ not enough)
```

Our binary search correctly found height 4 as the optimal cutter height.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log m), where:
  - n is the number of trees
  - m is the maximum tree height
  - The binary search takes O(log m) iterations
  - For each iteration, we calculate the wood cut in O(n) time
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. If all trees are the same height and the required wood is greater than 0, the answer is (height - 1) or less
2. If the required wood is 0, the answer is the maximum tree height
3. If the required amount of wood exceeds what can be cut (even at height 0), the problem has no solution
4. If the array is empty, return 0

## Key Insights

1. **Binary search efficiency**: This problem is a great example of using binary search to optimize a decision problem
2. **Monotonicity property**: As the cutter height decreases, the amount of wood cut monotonically increases
3. **Searching for the boundary**: We're looking for the highest height where the condition is still satisfied

## Conclusion

This problem tests your ability to:
1. Recognize when binary search can be applied beyond just searching in a sorted array
2. Work with decision problems where you need to find a boundary value
3. Implement a simulation function (calculating wood cut) efficiently

The optimal wood cutter height for our example is 4, which allows us to cut exactly the required 8 units of wood. This is the highest possible setting that satisfies our requirement.
