Applying to All Grind 108 DP Problems
Let’s quickly classify the Week 4 and Week 5 DP problems based on the number of choices at each moment:

Coin Change:
State: (current_amount, coin_index)
Choices: 2 (take or skip coins[coin_index]).
Approach: Lun Na Lun.
Why: Binary decision at each coin.
Longest Increasing Subsequence:
State: (index, prev_value)
Choices: 2 (take or skip nums[index] if valid).
Approach: Lun Na Lun.
Why: Binary decision at each position.
Word Break:
State: (start_index)
Choices: Many (all words that match the prefix).
Approach: For loop.
Why: Multiple prefixes to try.
Partition Equal Subset Sum:
State: (index, target)
Choices: 2 (take or skip nums[index]).
Approach: Lun Na Lun.
Why: Binary decision per number.
House Robber:
State: (index)
Choices: 2 (take nums[index] and skip index + 1, or skip index).
Approach: Lun Na Lun.
Why: Binary decision, though a for loop is possible for non-adjacent houses.
Decode Ways:
State: (index)
Choices: 2 (take 1 or 2 characters if valid).
Approach: Lun Na Lun-like.
Why: Limited choices (1 or 2 chars).
Combination Sum IV:
State: (current_target)
Choices: Many (all numbers in nums).
Approach: For loop.
Why: Try all numbers to reduce target.
Maximal Square:
State: (row, col) (if recursive)
Choices: Many (check neighbors for square size, typically iterative).
Approach: For loop (if recursive).
Why: Recursive DP is rare; iterative DP uses loops.
Unique Paths:
State: (row, col)
Choices: 2 (move right or down).
Approach: Lun Na Lun-like.
Why: Binary decision (two directions).
Regular Expression Matching (Week 5):
State: (s_index, p_index)
Choices: 2–3 (match char, skip with *, or skip pattern).
Approach: Lun Na Lun-like.
Why: Limited choices based on pattern rules.
Final Mental Model
At your “me” moment (your state in Main Hoon):

Count the choices in Bacho Jao:
1–2 choices (e.g., take/skip, right/down)? → Lun Na Lun. It’s clean, structured, and your favorite for FAANG clarity.
Many choices (e.g., all words, all numbers)? → For loop. It’s practical for exploring all options.
Check the state:
Position-based (e.g., index, start_index)? Lun Na Lun is likely, as you’re deciding on one element.
Quantity-based (e.g., current_target)? For loop is likely, as you’re searching for all ways to reduce it.
Visualize the tree:
Binary branches? Lun Na Lun.
Many branches? For loop.
Final Answer
Your rule—“if many forms at a moment, do for loop”—is perfect. At your state (Main Hoon), check the number of choices in Bacho Jao: many choices (e.g., all words in Word Break, all numbers in Combination Sum IV) → for loop; 1–2 choices (e.g., take/skip in Coin Change, LIS, Partition Equal Subset Sum) → Lun Na Lun. To make it natural, count choices out loud, draw a “choice star,” play “binary or bust,” and reflect after solving. This fits your Lun Na Lun preference while guiding you to for loops when needed.
