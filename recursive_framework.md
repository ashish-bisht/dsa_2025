# 🧠 Mastering Recursion with a Desi Twist:

## "Main Hoon, Kya Karoon, Bacho Jao, Kya Laya, Ye Lo!"

Recursion is beautiful. But let’s be honest — it can be confusing, especially under time pressure in coding interviews.

So we built a mental model that **feels natural, sticks like glue, and walks like a story**.

Presenting our very own **Recursive Framework**:

---

## 💡 The Framework:

> **"Main Hoon, Kya Karoon, Bacho Jao, Kya Laya, Ye Lo!"**
> *(Read it like a Bollywood monologue, and you’ll never forget recursion again!)*

Let’s break it down.

---

### 🯩 1. **Main Hoon** — *Who am I?*

> 📍 *Define the current subproblem/state*

This is where recursion begins.
You identify:

* The **parameters** passed to the function.
* The **current state** of the problem (e.g., current index, position, path so far).

This is *your identity* in the recursive tree.

> “Main hoon recursion ka is node pe farz…"

---

### 🚩 2. **Kya Karoon** — *Check and do?*

> 🔍 *Handle base cases, pruning, and state prep*

Here, we check:

* 🟢 **Base cases**: Did we reach a valid solution? Done?
* 🔴 **Fail fast**: Invalid states? Prune.
* 🧼 **Preprocessing**: Mark visited, modify board, memoize.

This step **saves time and avoids garbage paths**.

> “Agar kaam ho gaya ya galat raasta mila toh wahi pe ruk jaa…”

---

### 🡒 3. **Bacho Jao** — *Send kids!*

> 🔁 *Make recursive calls*

This is where recursion fans out.

You call:

* `recurse(next index)`
* `dfs(next cell)`
* `try all options`

This step builds the **recursive tree**.

> “Bacho, jao har raste pe try karo…”

---

### 🏃‍♂️ 4. **Kya Laya** — *What did the kids bring?*

> 📅 *Gather and combine results from children*

Collect results:

* `OR` → if one path solves the problem
* `SUM` → if counting all paths
* `MIN/MAX` → best path

Think of this as **aggregating the answers**.

> “Bachon, tumne kya seekha? Batao…”

---

### 🏱 5. **Ye Lo!** — *Here’s the answer!*

> ✅ *Return answer or cache result*

Now, based on what you got, you:

* Return the answer
* Cache result in a `dp` table (for memoization)

> “Ye lo, maine solve kar diya — ab yaad bhi rakh liya!”

---

## 🧪 Example: Fibonacci (Classic)

```python
def fib(n):
    # Main Hoon
    if n <= 1:
        # Kya Karoon (Base Case)
        return n

    # Bacho Jao
    left = fib(n - 1)
    right = fib(n - 2)

    # Kya Laya
    ans = left + right

    # Ye Lo
    return ans
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Works

* ✅ **Memorable** — It’s rhythmic and playful.
* ✅ **Complete** — Covers state, base case, branching, merging, returning.
* ✅ **Debug-friendly** — You can add print statements at each stage.
* ✅ **Teachable** — Works great when explaining recursion to others or interviewing.

## 📌 Print This & Stick It On Your Wall

```text
🔁  Recursion Framework 🔁
------------------------------------
1️⃣ Main Hoon     → Identify the current state  
2️⃣ Kya Karoon    → Base case + Pruning + Setup  
3️⃣ Bacho Jao     → Call the children (recurse)  
4️⃣ Kya Laya      → Aggregate results  
5️⃣ Ye Lo         → Return or memoize
```

---

## 🧙 Bonus: Use it for...

* DFS/BFS on trees/graphs
* Backtracking (sudoku, N-Queens)
* DP with memoization
* Combinatorics (subsets, permutations)
* Interview problems (Leetcode-style)

## 🎮 Final Thoughts

In the world of recursion, you are the **parent** — responsible, logical, calm.
You define yourself, check your limits, send your kids, ask them what they learned, and then… **return an answer that the world needs.**

Just remember:

> **"Main Hoon, Kya Karoon, Bacho Jao, Kya Laya, Ye Lo!"**
